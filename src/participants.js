      'The Roop are 3 band members from Lithuania who describe their musical style as a mix of pop-rock and indie. Although they have only been working together since 2014, all band members have been involved in the music industry much longer.',
      'The Roop\'s debut album, To Whom It May Concern, came out in 2015. The band has since played music around the world, from Lithuania to Belgium, Serbia and Brazil. The band previously tried their hand at Lithuania\'s national selection in 2018 but came up short that time. Talking about giving it another shot, lead singer Vaidotas Valiukeviƒçius said: "This year‚Äôs song is about something I carried within and observed around myself. It‚Äôs about writing yourself off too quickly. We are underestimating ourselves too often. We think we don‚Äôt meet some standards or that we are uninteresting, too young, too old."'
